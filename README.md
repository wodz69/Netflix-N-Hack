# Instructions

### Extended Storage Setup

> [!WARNING]
> This will wipe your drive.

**Disclaimer:** Only works on PS5s that have an activated account. Real PSN account or Fake activated via jailbreak.

**Do not update your console to activate!** Use System backup method below

### Requirements for PS4 Version

The PS4 version of Netflix requires a license.

**You may have the license if:**
1. You have previously installed Netflix but deleted it.
2. You currently have the retail application installed and can run it without jailbreaking. (Not the one from homebrew store/pkg zone)
3. You have a real PSN account activated as primary.

If you don't know if you have the license, you can still try flashing the extended storage image for your region (region relevant only for PS4) and testing to see if the Netflix app will work. If it stays locked, it means you don't have a license and you will not be able to use the jailbreak.

**Requirements to flash the extended storage image:**
1. PS4 firmware 9.00-12.02
2. 256GB or larger (up to 8TB) USB drive / External HDD / External SSD
3. Must be USB 3.0 connection

> [!TIP]
> If you have a higher version application than the vulnerable 1.53 version, delete it and flash an extended storage image to a drive — it'll give you the 1.53 version.

> [!NOTE]
> Alternatively, if you can already jailbreak, instead of flashing an extended storage image you can install the retail version of Netflix and use it afterwards. **Still requires a license.**

---

### Extended Storage Drive Setup (PS4)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before plugging in the extended storage drive, delete the Netflix app from your PS4 if you have it installed. Then turn off the console, plug in the extended storage drive, and turn the console back on.

#### Step 1: Download balenaEtcher
- Download **balenaEtcher** for Windows, macOS, or Linux from:
  [https://etcher.balena.io](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher)

#### Step 2: Download the Image Archive
- Download the **`.7z` archive** for your region from the [**Releases** section.](https://github.com/earthonion/Netflix-N-Hack/releases/tag/External-Drive) For PS4 the Images are Netflix_PS4_xx.7z ,US/EU/JP to indicate the region they are for.
> [!NOTE]
> Extended Storage does not require an exact capacity beyond the minimum of 256GB. Meaning that if your drive is 256GB you can use the image. If your drive is 500GB you can use the image. Or if it is 1TB you can use the image and etc up to 8TB. But if it is 250GB you cannot use the image.**
- The `.7z` download size is roughly ~**95-200 MB** and around 400MB unpacked.

> - **500 GB image:** ~**15 minutes**
> - **1 TB image:** ~**25 minutes**
> - **2 TB image:** ~**45 minutes**
> - **4 TB image:** ~**80 minutes**
>
> Etcher will appear stuck at **0%** for a while, then at **85-99%** for several minutes.
> This is normal, let it finish without interruption!
> If you encounter damaged image warnings, reboot your pc, redownload the image or use a different enclosure/motherboard slot for the m.2 SSD.

#### Step 5: Install the M.2 Drive in the PS5
- Power off the PS5 completely.
- Install the imaged **M.2 SSD** into the PS5’s internal M.2 slot.
- Power the PS5 back on; the console should now see the preinstalled Netflix app, viewable under `Storage` settings.
- Move app from the M.2 to console storage, then reformat the M.2 drive in under `Storage` settings to safely continue using it.

#### Step 6: Move the Netflix App to Internal Storage

# Self-host mitmproxy with Docker

## Requirements

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Installation & Usage

Copy the `.env.example` to `.env`.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` and change the `IP_SCRIPT` variable to the IP of the device that will host mitmproxy. Optionally change `IP_SCRIPT_PORT` if `8080` is already used.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Check the logs to ensure the services are deployed successfully.

```bash
docker logs -f --tail 10 mitmproxy
```

```bash
docker logs -f --tail 10 ws
```

Continue to the **Network / Proxy Setup** section.

# How to run proxy locally

## Requirements

- Python (for `mitmproxy`)
- `mitmproxy` (`pip install mitmproxy`)

---

## Installation & Usage

```bash
# install mitmproxy
pip install mitmproxy

# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/earthonion/Netflix-N-Hack/
cd Netflix-N-Hack

# run mitmproxy with the provided script
mitmproxy -s proxy.py

```

Current script will trigger after the WebSocket for remote logging is initiated.

```bash
# install websockets
pip install websockets

# Generate Keys
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -subj "/CN=localhost"

# run WebSocket server
python ws.py

```

### Network / Proxy Setup

On your PS5:

1. Go to Settings > Network > Settings > Set Up Internet Connection.

2. Scroll to the bottom and select Set Up Manually.

3. Choose Connection Type **Use Wi-Fi** or **Use a LAN Cable**
If using **Wi-Fi**:
Choose **Enter Manually**, Enter your SSID **Wi-Fi network name**. Set **Security Method** to **WPA-Personal/WPA2..** (or similar) then Enter your ***Wi-Fi network password**.

4. Use Automatic for DNS Settings and MTU Settings.

5. At Proxy Server, choose Use and enter:

- IP address: \<your local machine IP\>

- Port: 8080

6. Press Done and wait for the connection to establish
- You may see **Can't connect to the internet** — this is expected and can be ignored after pressing OK.

> Make sure your PC running mitmproxy is on the same network and reachable at your local IP.

### Open Netflix and wait.


> [!NOTE]
If you see elfldr listening on port 9021 you can send your elf payload.

### if it fails reboot and try again

### Troubleshooting
- If the Netflix application crashes shortly after opening it, reopen it to retry.
- If you see a green text error "Exception" press X or O to retry.
- If Lapse fails you will see a notification telling you to reboot the console, you must reboot to retry.

### P2JB
For PS5 firmwares between 10.x - 12.40 inclusive, an implementation of P2JB is available. This is a port of matem6/P2JB-Y2JB-Porting with changes requried by the NF app environment (use uncompressed reads/writes, avoid the use of pthread_create/scePthreadCreate, minimize garbage creation). According to my testing, the exploit is relatively stable on 2 cores but unstable on 3+.
Instructions of running the P2JB implementation:
- start the proxy in the same way as with the lapse variant, start ws.py script for websocket logging
- run the Netflix app and wait for remote_js_loader notofication
- send p2jb payload to the remote JS loader, wait till complete
```bash
python payload_sender.py <IP_OF_YOUR_PS5> payloads/p2jb.js
```
Once complete (ETA ~70min), it will launch elfldr via kexp on the usual port (9021) and return the control to remote_js_loader. At this point, Netflix app can be safely closed without crashing. Please note: a customized kexp (payloads/kexp_no_pthreads.bin_, that launches elfldr directly instead of using pthread_create, is used. This is because pthread_create crashes during TLS allocation on 10.x firmwares (and I presumably all higher versions).
For disc-based PS5 users: elfldr can be used to (un)patch bdjstack.jar (see BD-UN-JB project) to provide a much faster JB method on supported firmwares)
The jailbreak also enables the debug menu, which can be used to install Youtube app without restoring a backup (see Y2JB github repo for details and pkg & update files):
- install YT pkg from USB using the debug men
- launch YT app and close
- copy download0.dat to the required location (e.g. by using ftpsrv payload injected via elfldr)
- YT app should now be exploitable
